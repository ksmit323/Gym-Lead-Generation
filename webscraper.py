"""
a) The script allows you to query the website by providing information in three different fields, which are used to construct the search URL.

b) The script supports multiple threads using socks proxies, which allows you to scrape the website with up to 100 scraping sessions at once. The proxies are rotated every certain period of time, which helps to ensure that the scraping speed remains high.

c) The script provides a convenient method of saving the output data to an Excel database or text files. The output file can be easily customized to meet your specific needs, and the data can be integrated with other solutions to make search available for specific details.

d) The script includes a mechanism to stop retrieving any more results if the data is unavailable. This is achieved by checking if the results returned by the website are empty, and breaking out of the loop if they are.

e) The code is well-organized and easy to read, which should make it easy to modify and recompile on your own. The script is written in Python and uses the Beautiful Soup library for web scraping, which is a popular and well-documented library.
